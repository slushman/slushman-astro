I've been accepted to speak at [WordCamp Dayton](https://dayton.wordcamp.org/2015/) this year! I'll be speaking on using [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://wppb.me). I've been using the boilerplate for the past few months for all my plugins. I've found it extremely useful and well crafted. In my presentation, I'll be going over the basics of how it works, why you'd want to use it. I'll also show code for basic plugin things like widgets, metaboxes, post types, and plugin settings.

Look forward to seeing you there!
