In WordPress, the submit_button() function echoes a submit button. However, there are occasions where one might need a submit button, but not echoed. Like when returning a form from a function. For those occasions, use the [get_submit_button()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_submit_button) function instead. get_submit_button() accepts the same arguments as submit_button(), but returns instead of echoing.
