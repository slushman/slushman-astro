I was working with some AJAX functionality a while back and started writing down the problems and solutions I ran across so they were all in one place. Basically, this post is for my future self. I hope you find it useful as well. :)

## Specific Problems

### Function Always Returns 0

If you're getting a "0" as the response from an AJAX call in the admin, it's most likely one of three things:

- WordPress can't find the function you've hooked.
- You don't have a wp_die() at the end of the PHP function.
- The action isn't in the data you're sending to the PHP function.

### 403 Forbidden Error

Check the Nonce. You probably copied it from another function and it's checking the wrong one.

## Helpful Tip

The PHP function that processes the AJAX request has to echo something and should end with:

```php
wp_die();
```

You can use that to return something you want to see, like what data was passed to the function.

To check an array, use this instead:

```php
wp_die(print_r($some_array));
```
