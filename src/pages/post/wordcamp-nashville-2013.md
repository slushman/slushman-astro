I'm excited to say I've been invited to speak at this year's WordCamp Nashville! I'll be speaking on Building Your First Widget and giving away from boilerplate code here on my site to get you started with building your first widget. I'll also post my slides here after Saturday's talk. I hope anyone near Nashville can come to [WordCamp](https://nashville.wordcamp.org/2013/), I'd love to meet you and we can all learn more about WordPress together!
