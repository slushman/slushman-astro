In case you haven't heard, ArtistData is shutting down. Since ArtistDataPress merely re-displays the feed from ArtistData, the plugin will also be shutting down. The final date is October 14.

I recommend checking out either BandsInTown or GigPress. BandsInTown covers the online service bit; GigPress keeps everything on your site. I've seen good results from both, so you can't lose.
