When building a website have you ever wanted to leave a note, an explanation, a warning, or maybe even a joke or an Easter egg for someone looking at that code in the future?

Comments are a common feature in many programming languages, including HTML.

## Why use HTML comments?

1. Comment out code as you learn to write what you want
2. Group code together logically
3. For fun, like leaving some ASCII art, a joke, an Easter egg, or a poem

## How do you write comments in HTML?

The syntax for writing an HTML comment is:

```html
<!-- This is the comment content -->
```

You can put whatever you want between the opening and closing tags, like a URL:

```html
<!-- https://www.slushman.com -->
```

Or even code:

```html
<!--
<div class="example">
  <p>Part of the website I want commented out.</p>
</div>
-->
```

Notice that last example covers multiple lines!

## Where can you put HTML comments

The following code sample shows all the valid ways to write comments in HTML, like:

- On the line before code
- On the line after code
- Before code, on the same line
- After code, on the same line
- Inside the content

```html
<!-- On the line before code -->
<div class="example">
  <!-- Before code, same line --><p>Some content on the website.</p>
  <p>Some content <!-- Comment inside content --> on the website.</p>
  <p>Some content on the website.</p><!-- After code, same line -->
</div>
<!-- On the line after code -->
```

## Where not to put HTML comments

There are places where you should not put comments, like:

- Inside a tag
- Inside an attribute

```html
<div <!-- Invalid comments inside a tag --> class="example">
  <p>Some content on the website.</p>
  <p>Some content on the website.</p>
  <p class="example <!-- Invalid comments inside an attribute -->">Some content on the website.</p>
</div>
```
