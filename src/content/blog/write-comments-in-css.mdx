Have you ever used a magic number in your CSS and wanted to leave a comment to explain it?

## How do you write comments in CSS?

The syntax for writing a CSS comment is:

```css
/* This is a single-line comment in CSS */
```

```css
/* This is a 
multiple-line comment
in CSS */
```

## Where can you put CSS comments

The following code sample shows all the valid ways to write comments in CSS, like:

- On the line before the styles
- On the line after the styles
- Same line, before the declaration
- Same line, after the declaration
- Same line, in the middle of the declaration

```css
/* On the line before the styles */
p {
  color: red; /* Same line, after the declaration */
  /* Same line, before the declaration */ display: flex;
  display: /* Same line, in the middle of the declaration */ flex;
}
/* On the line after the styles */
```
