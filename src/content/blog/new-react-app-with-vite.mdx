When you find yourself looking up the same set of instructions and consistently finding the wrong ones over and over again, it's time to document things for yourself. So, future self (and everyone else), this is how to create a new React app using Vite. This uses Typescript as well.

FYI, I'm using yarn for all the instructions here. If you prefer something else, you'll need to translate it to the correct commands; they are slightly different.

Run this command in your terminal to create the project and starter files:

```bash
yarn create vite app-name --template react-ts
```

Next, go into the folder, install all the dependencies, then get started:

```bash
cd app-name && yarn install && yarn dev
```

Go build stuff!
