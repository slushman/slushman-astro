If you're getting an error related to [get_theme_mod](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_theme_mod/), its most likely from how you're checking if the returned result is empty. Most developers will probably do the same thing I did: make a variable and assign it to the result of get_theme_mod. Then check if its empty using PHP's [empty()](https://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php) method. Sadly, this is where you're getting an error. Instead, check if the result is equal to '', or blank.

```php
/**
 * Do this
 */
if ('' === get_theme_mod('something')) { ... }

/**
 * Not this
 */
if (empty(get_theme_mod('something'))) { ... }
```
