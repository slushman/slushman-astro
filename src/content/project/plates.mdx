Plates helps track the license plates you see while on a roadtrip; used for the classic roadtrip license plate game.

The scores vary based on which state is selected. The larger the state, the fewer the points. License plates from other countries, like Mexico and Canada, as well as US Territories like Guam or Puerto Rico are worth more points. Native American tribe plates are worth the most points.

## Tech used
* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Tailwind

## Road Map (future plans)
* Add pictures of each state's plate
* Add all state plate variations. Add setting to track each variation separately
* Change points based on the user's current location. States that are further away are worth more points
* Log in to save previous games or sync a game across multiple users (like all family members in the same car)
